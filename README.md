<p align="center">
I focus on understanding how software actually works — from operating system primitives to backend execution paths.

## Technical Focus

My work and learning revolve around:

- Backend system design and API architecture  
- Operating system fundamentals (processes, memory, I/O)  
- Networking from sockets to application protocols  
- Data modeling, consistency, and failure handling  
- Debugging and performance-oriented thinking  

I prefer depth, correctness, and clarity over rapid tool accumulation.

## Projects

### StorageApp
A backend-oriented storage system treated as a long-lived product.

- File handling and metadata management  
- API contracts, validation, and structured error handling  
- Persistence design and access control  
- Emphasis on system boundaries and predictable behavior

### Hostel Management System
A production-style backend application, not a classroom CRUD project.

- Authentication, authorization, and role-based access  
- Clear separation of concerns in backend layers  
- Defensive coding and consistent error responses  
- Database schema design with real-world constraints
